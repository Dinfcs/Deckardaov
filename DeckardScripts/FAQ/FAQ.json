  {
    "question": "What do I do if I have doubts about the structure?",
    "answer": "The structure must always be determined based on the listing, not on the PR or GIS. Remember that PRs and GIS are only guides and do not have the final word. Therefore, you should always review the available information in the description, title, photos, rental platforms, and use tools such as aerial and street view, which will help identify the correct structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to identify a listing of a Recreational Vehicle RV?",
    "answer": "It depends on the specific RV:\n\nRV nestled: The RV is identified as having surrounding structures such as a bathroom, terrace, or others that make it a permanent location at that point. All information is entered in Cyborg as a regular listing. This information is filled out with structure = RV.\n\nRV movable and Yachts/Boats: If it is observed that the RV can be easily moved, it is marked as RV in structure and outside boundaries so that it is not shown in Rentalscope. In this case, you normally can not identify an APN, so you only input the structure and outside boundaries.\n\nCamping sites/Yurts/Glampings/Tents: All information is filled out with structure = RV and all other data. Some of these structures can be easily moved, so is better to use the instructions for RV movable..\n\nFor RVs (Movable) and yachts/boats, it's not necessary to mark them as NMF. Simply label them as Outside Boundaries and mark the structure as RV."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I confirm if a listing is a timeshare or not?",
    "answer": "Timeshares are properties in which multiple parties hold the right to use the property based on an assigned period - usually identifiable because it's only available for a few weeks. Usually has the words \"Worldmark\", \"Timeshare\" or \"Fractional\" in the listing or Public Record.\n\nTimeshares usually have different APNs for each unit or building. However, they typically share the same owner across all APNS.\nYou must select one APN, commonly the APN associated with shared areas like pools, sports courts and others."

  {
    "question": "How do I know if a listing is a resort or not?",
    "answer": "A resort can be recognized by the use of that land. If the public records state in the parcel type that the parcel is a Hotel/Motel/Resort/Bed and Breakfast/Lodging this can be considered a resort.\n\nHowever, in some cases, a listing may state the property is commercial but this is not necessarily true. In those cases where the property type is \"commercial\", but, you can notice the business run in that parcel is different from lodging, which falls in the client's scope or interest.\n\nExample:\nThe listing says the property is a bed and breakfast, and when you check the public recards it says \"Commercial Store\". Then, you notice on the first floor of this property there is a store and the rooms are on the second floor. In that situation, we identify the property as a unit (1 of many) as the type of business they are allowed to run there is not lodging. You may find listings within commercial porcels such as farms, agricultural, wineries, office buildings, stores, and so on. Keep in mind these businesses are not rental businesses and it could be interesting for the client to know about them.\n\nResorts can often be identified by common keywords in the name, such as: Inc, LLC, Marriott, Inn, and similar terms. Additionally, they often appear as hotels on Google Maps, which is another helpful indicator when determining if the structure is a resort-type property.\n\nPublic Records (PRs) are not the only source to determine if a structure is a resort. You should also consider other indicators."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I confirm if a listing is a Unit one of many (U1OM)?",
    "answer": "You may notice that the entire structure has only 1 APN but multiple different units within it. It could be something like 1 unit of a 4-unit complex or 1 apartment within an 8-unit apartment building.\n\nYou can recognize this in the public records in the type section as \"Multi-family residence\", \"Apartments\", etc. You can also check the number of buildings within a parcel to give you an idea that it might be a U10M).\n\nAnother way to identify whether a property is a U1OM is by reviewing the parcel using aerial and Street View imagery to spot additional structures and/or separate access points to different units. Also, check if the property has 2 or more floors.\n\nYou can also compare the listing with rental platforms to analyze the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens.\n\nIn some cases, you may notice there are multiple structures within a parcel of similar characteristics and seems to be a Single Family Residence. Even though the public records say it is SFR, we can label that parcel as a unit(1 of many).\n\nU1OM properties can often be identified by keywords such as \"unit,\" \"rental unit,\" \"duplex,\" etc. These terms are typically found in the listing title or in the description."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct structure for a fully rented multi-family property?",
    "answer": "In this case, let's suppose we have a Duplex (the house has 2 units (A and B)). In one listing they rent unit A (Unit one of many), in another listing, they rent unit B (Unit one of many). In another listing, they rent units A and B, in this listing the correct structure is Main Structure because they are renting the units altogether, and is the whole portion of that parcel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between an ADU and a unit (U10M)?",
    "answer": "Even though ADU and unit (1 of many) are inside the very same parcel and have the same owner, the main difference between these structures is the type of parcel. A unit (1 of many) is a \"Multi-family residence\", an ADU is located within a \"Single Family Residence\" type.\n\nAn ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) is a small structure within a parcel that is not the main house and has everything needed to live (private entrance, kitchenette, bathroom, etc.). A unit (1 of many) is a structure within a parcel where there are more structures with similar characteristics and sizes.\n\nRemember that a kitchenette must include a stove, not just a coffee maker and a microwave."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to map a property that is \"commercial\" but has a residential area?",
    "answer": "It will be mapped such as U1OM, taking into account that there are two units, the residential unit and the commercial unit.\nExample:\nThe property on the first floor is a business office and on the second floor is the rental unit.\nThis instruction applies to all parcels that have both residential and commercial components, such as restaurants, offices, barbershops, and similar establishments."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do I need to use rental override?",
    "answer": "Starting May 24th, 2024, this step is removed from the address mapping process.\n\nPreviously: When you identify the auto-inferred rental type cyborg suggests is not the correct one. For example, the listing is renting a room, and Cyborg inferred it is self-contained. In that case, you have to change the rental to not self_contained as a room corresponds to this type.\n\nIt's no longer necessary to manually change the rental override in Cyborg. If it is easily identifiable, it's good practice to update it. But if not, you can leave it as inferred by Cyborg."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have an event space is it necessary to mark it as outside boundaries?",
    "answer": "No, when you have an event space you don't need to mark it as outside boundaries. You just need to map it as usual and the structure would be \"event space\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when two (or more) main structures are being rented together?",
    "answer": "The first step is to identify the units being rented. Typically, they are contiguous units. Once you have identified them, choose one of the units and map it as usual. The only difference is that you need to write down a comment indicating that the listing is for multiple units, as shown below.\n\nAfter soving the listing, search for duplicates. If duplicates are found, divide them between the units on the listing. For example, if three duplicates are found and the listing rents two different units, assign two duplicates to unit #1 and the other duplicate to unit #2. This way, all the units being rented will be identified by Cyborg."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if the kitchen is outside the ADU?",
    "answer": "If you think a listing might be an ADU but you're not sure because the kitchen is located outside the structure (e.g., in the backyard, inside the main house, etc.), this is NO longer considered an ADU. In this case, it is considered as Main structure Not Self Contained.\n\nHowever, it is still important to consult with your data lead to confirm your case."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can there be any ADUs within a unit (U1OM)?",
    "answer": "Yes, there can be one or even multiple ADUs within a unit one of many.\n\nExample 1: A small unit with a private entrance, bathroom, and kitchenette behind a duplex.\n\nYou can recognize an ADU within a U10M by comparing the size of the structures in the parcel. An ADU will always be smaller in size and there could be multiple ADUs in a U10M.\n\nExample 2: There are four units with 2bd-2bo completely private with full kitchens and other four units with 1bd-1ba completely private and kitchenettes. In that case, the four bigger units would be flagged as U10M and the other four as ADUS.\n\nIf you have doubts consult with your Data Lead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can there be more than one ADU in a property?",
    "answer": "Yes, there can be multiple ADUs within one property. Keep in mind the size of the structures and what they include. The structures would usually have 1bd-1ba, a private entrance, a private bathroom, and a kitchenette, also they would look alike and the ADUs should have similar size."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should I proceed if an ADU is identified?",
    "answer": "When an ADU is identified, it needs to have its own property card to separate it from the main structure it is attached to. This process is performed using the unit box.\n1. When there are multiple ADUs on the same parcel but they are not identified with any number or letter, you must write \"ADU\" (in all caps) in the unit box, followed by a number (e.g., ADU1, ADU2, ADU3, etc.).\n2. When there is an ADU and it has assigned a unit identifier, you should only enter the number or letter shown in the listing in the unit box.\n\nExample: If the listing shows a photo with the letter \"A\", then you should enter just \"A\" in the unit box (without the word ADU).\nThis process should be performed each time we identify an ADU, whether or not it has another listing with the main structure.\n\nTake into account that the word ADU needs to be in capital letters.\n\nIt is important to check if the unit box matches with the license (if applicable)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Could be an ADU Non_self contained?",
    "answer": "Yes, since it's possible that only part of the ADU is being rented out and the tenant has to share spaces like the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nIn this description of in this listing, you can see clearly how it states it is a room inside an ADU since the main house: \"We are just a short walk away in the main, front home but a large-tall fence provides total privacy\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I map a house rental inside an RV park?",
    "answer": "First, it's important to carefully check what exactly is being rented in the listing and to verify the type of parcel. If the parcel is made up exclusively of RVs, then that structure should be used.\n\nHowever, if the parcel includes shared amenities like pools or sports courts and also has RVs, it should be classified as U10M.\n\nIf you still have questions about your case, we recommend consulting with the Data Lead."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I use the unit box?",
    "answer": "The unit box is used when you come across an U1OM or ADU and you know the specific unit that your listing is referring to. When inputting the unit number, you do not need to write down \"Unit\" in the box. Instead, just use the number, letters, or a combination of both. For example, you could enter \"1B\", \"8\", or \"D\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "When to Use or Not Use Address Override?",
    "answer": "When to Use Cyborg Address Override:\n\n1.  Incorrect Format: When Cyborg shows a weird format in the address, such as \"NONE\" or missing street number.\n2.  Missing Unit: If the unit number is missing from the main address (Most common in condos), override the main address with the corresponding unit number.\n3.  Incorrect Unit Number: If the indicated unit differs from the verified one.\n4.  Errors in Street Number or Name: Such as an incorrect street number (e.g., 123 vs. 125) or wrong name (e.g., Main vs. Maine).\n5.  Incorrect Directional or Street Type: If there are errors in direction (N/E/S/W) or in street type (ave/st/rd).\n6.  APN Validation: If the listing is outside boundaries or the information is outdated, check \"skip APN validation.\"\n7.  No Match Found: If you know the main address but not the unit, use the format with \"# unk.\" Include the Partial APN if necessary.\n\nWhen Not to Use Address Override:\n\n1.  Capitalization issues (e.g., Main St vs. Main ST).\n2.  Punctuation or comma errors.\n3.  Incorrect city names if recognizable on the map.\n4.  Missing state or ZIP code.\n\nExamples of When and How to Do Address Override\nThere is a very useful tool available that can help you complete the Address Override (AO) process more quickly and easily. You can find the tool [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X...). If you have any questions about how the tool works, you can find more information in Confluence under Address Override Tool.\n\nSome clients may request specific guidelines for their project that can take priority over these instructions, so it's essential to review the project resources.\n\nPlease remember the structure of an address has to be written in the following way as it is going to be displayed on Rentalscape:\n[House number] [Street name], [City], [STATE ABBREVIATION] [zip code]\nExample: 8245 E Bell Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85260\nIf it includes a Unit: 8245 E Bell Rd Unit 229, Scottsdale, AZ 85260\nNO_MATCH_FOUND- If you know the main address and not the Unit: 8245 E Bell Rd Unit # unk, Scottsdale, AZ 85260\n\nThe address override in Australia. For example: 65 Henderson St. Camp Hill, QLD 4152\nIf it includes a Unit: 6904/222 Margaret St. Brisbane City, QLD 4000\nNO_MATCH_FOUND If you know the building and not the Unit Australia: Unit # unk/222 Margaret St. Brisbane City, QLD 4000\n\nWhen cyborg brings an address with the street suffix without abbreviation and unit number with # or apt, is not necessary to perform oddress override if the address is correct, if something needs to be fixed, perform address override and be sure to use the instructions above.\n\nPlease write only 5 digits for the zip code, no additional numbers.\nPlease do not include the name of the County in the address.\nPlease do not include this: USA, EEUU, AUS, and Australio when you address override."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do I do when I find the APN for a listing that previously had the Address Override in NMF?",
    "answer": "When we are working on Final Pass in a condominium that is divided into units, the person who previously searched it must have written down the address in the address override box including \"Unit # unk\" as seen in the photo below. When we finally find the unit, we have to delete this address override, otherwise, Rentalscape will show the Address Override and not the unit we found."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if an APN is not showing an address in Cyborg?",
    "answer": "If we match a property and Cyborg doesn't display the address or shows an incorrect one, we need to determine if an address override is necessary. Here's how to proceed:\n1.  Check for 'No Situs': If the APN lacks an address in Public Records or GIS, check if it states 'No Situs'. This means the government hasn't assigned on address.\n2.  Long Term Rental (LTR) Sites: Look for the address on Zillow, Realtor, or Redfin. Ensure the address leads to the correct parcel.\n3.  Other Rental Platforms (Regrid, Lightbox): If no LTR address is available, check Regrid or similar rental platforms, verifying the address matches the correct parcel.\n4.  Google Maps/Nearmaps: If the address is still missing, try Google Maps or Nearmaps, but only use the address if the pin accurately points to the property.\n5.  RV Commercial Name: If it's an RV with a commercial nome (e.g., 'RV desert', 'Yurt desert', 'Cabin Mountain', 'Norske Camp'), use that name in the Address Override.\n6.  No Address Found: If no address is found anywhere, enter \"NoSitus APN [APN Number] in the Address Override Box (e.g., \"NoSitus APN 12345678'). Also, add the coordinates in the Cyborg comments.\n7.  House with No Information: If it is a house and you do not have any relevant information to put an address, you can reach any data lead to check the case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do I do if I find a discrepancy in the address across different sources?",
    "answer": "PR and GIS are guides; however, they do not have the final word. Therefore, it is important to review the different information sources we have, such as LB, PQ, and Google Maps, and based on that, choose the most accurate address, always making sure it leads directly to the correct parcel.\n\nIf you notice that the correct address is different from the one provided by Cyborg, it is necessary to do an AO."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if the unit number is not shown in the address?",
    "answer": "For condominiums that have a different APN for each unit, the unit number must be included in the address. For instance, if the address Cyborg displays lacks the unit number and the public records do not show it in the property address, you will find the unit number in the legal description. In this case, it is your responsibility to override the listing with the correct unit number."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does sometimes do I have to use Address Override alongside the Unit Box?",
    "answer": "Sometimes, there are different addresses within the same APN, those can be because the unit is different or because the principal number is different. Here we have some examples:\n\nWhen within a Multi-family structure the address given by Cyborg and the Public Records includes a unit and it is not the one in your listing, you input your unit number in the unit box and perform address override. This is to separate the unit into a different card, thus each known unit will be shown in Rentalscape on its own.\n\nWithin a Multi-family parcel, there are different principal addresses and you know which one your listing belongs to. In this case, you perform an address override with the right ane and input in the unit box the number of the street.\n\nWhen an Address Override is required for any reason on a multi-family parcel (e.g., missing address in Cyborg, incorrect street number or street name, missing cardinal direction, etc.), if the unit number is known, the unit number must be included both in the Address Override and in the Unit Box.\n\nIf the unit number is unknown, the Address Override should be done using the general address."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to input the APN on Cyborg even if the property is outside boundaries?",
    "answer": "Yes, you input the APN normally in Cyborg even if the property is outside of boundaries. Rentalscape will adjust the dot if it is outside, so there is no need to mark it as outside of the current region in Cyborg.\n\nIf Cyborg does not recognize the APN it might be because the listing is in a different county, in that case, you select the correct state and county.\n\nIf Cyborg even doesn't recognize the information, and you are sure the information is correct, then click on \"Skip apn validation\" and provide the Address Override in the correct format."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Cyborg not accept the APN?",
    "answer": "Sometimes cyborg has a different structure for the APN than the ones we found on platforms like Regrid, Lightbox, Parcelquest, GIS or even the public records. Those can include more Os at the end of the APN given on those platforms or even some other numbers before the APN, in those cases is better for you to go to parcels and check the APN with the address. Another thing you could do is follow the pattern seen in the APN in the list of \"Nearby parcels\" to know what is missing from yours and just add the other numbers (or letters) by hand.\n\nFor projects in California, the data provider is ParcelQuest, and for projects outside of California, the data provider is Lightbox."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to find the parcels that are loaded in Cyborg?",
    "answer": "Parcels are uploaded by counties. You can find them using [this link](https://cyborg.deckard.com/parcel/STATE/county_name/) changing the name of the state in uppercase and the name of the county in lowercase.\nYou can also go to the parcels tab on the top of the project once you have opened it on cyborg and all the parcels within the county/city will be there."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do when I cannot find an APN on \"Nearby parcels\"?",
    "answer": "First of all, go to parcels and try to find it with the address of the listing. If this does not work, then go to the Public Records or GIS of your project (Lightbox works great as well) and input the address you know.\n\nSometimes Lightbox does not have its data updated so if you do not find the address, put the APN in parcels (you can use the one on the Public Records), it most likely will not be recognized so tick the \"skip apn validation\" box and use address override for it to save."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are there multiple addresses highlighted for the same APN?",
    "answer": "When working with projects that include multiple licenses, Cyborg may display each license as a separate address, as shown in the image above. Although each license may appear to be for a different location, they are all attached to the same APN. Therefore, don't worry if you see multiple addresses for the same property. You can map any of the licenses with the same APN, and Cyborg will show the same address for each one."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the project is in two or more counties?",
    "answer": "Follow the steps below:\n\n1.  Search for the project in the Public Records and read the Important Info. The leader will always provide the link to the public records of all the counties to which the project belongs.\n2.  Identify and map the listing as usual.\n3.  Identify whether the APN is associated with the county linked to the project in Cyborg. You can find this information in the region list when accessing the project in Cyborg.\n4.  If the APN is in a different county, it will end with an \"@\" to indicate which county it is in.\n5.  Verify the property information in the respective Public Records and make address override if it is necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the partial APN?",
    "answer": "When you are unable to identify a property located within a condominium with multiple units, you must use the partial APN box to write down the first numbers of the APN, which are the same for every unit. For the numbers that change based on the unit, use XXXX as a placeholder. It is important to also include the address of the condo in the comments section so that the next person can easily find it. After this, remember to fill in the address override.\n\nThe purpose of this is to group listings with similar APNs together since they belong to the same condominium."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to input an evidence secondary when I find a duplicate of an already mapped listing?",
    "answer": "No. When you have identified a listing that has been identified as duplicated is not essential to input secondary evidence, please input the Deckard ID of the original listing in the comments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the right way to identify duplicates?",
    "answer": "When dealing with duplicates, there are two different scenarios to consider:\n\n1.  When you are mapping normally and not in the duplicate bucket:\n    * You have already mapped your original listing, and then you find other listings that are not mapped, and they seem similar.\n    * You have not mapped your listing yet, but you find other listings that have already been mapped.\n    In both cases, you need to make sure that the duplicates are indeed related to your listing, and not just external images or descriptions that match. You can verify this by looking at the pictures, host, and geo.\n    Once you have confirmed that they are duplicates, you need to be careful about changing buckets from listing to listing, for example, the unit number, NMF address override or the structure.\n\n2.  When you use the duplicate bucket:\n    Your job is to ensure the duplicate is, in fact, a duplicate. You do not need to perform QA on the original listing since this bucket is used for fast identification. But you need to be careful of different details such as structure, host name, and unit number since they can differ in different cases."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to map duplicates?",
    "answer": "1. Click on the duplicate button.\n2. Copy and paste the ID of the listing that you want to duplicate.\n3. Click \"Accept and it will automatically load the information from the listing you wanted to duplicate."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do I use property manager boxes?",
    "answer": "If you are unable to find a property, there is another important box to fill out: the Property Managers box. First, determine if the listing is managed by a property manager. If it is, try to find the requested data in the Excel attached on col-address-mapping and cyborg. If you cannot find it easily, simply input what you have found.\n\nTo fill out this field, you go to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1...) where you need to fill out the following fields:\n* Project: Select the name of the project where you found the property manager (mandatory field).\n* Property Manager Name: Name of the real estate agency or person who acts as the property manager. (mandatory field).\n* Post Address: Address of the real estate agency, work office, or property manager.\n* E-mail: E-mail address of the business or property manager.\n* Phone: Phone number to contact the property manager.\n* Listing: Link of the listing (mandatory field).\n* Reported by?: Submit your name (mandatory field)\n\nIf you do not find important information about the property manager, it is better not to include it in the list, as we need at least some information, either by e-mail, phone or address to contact the person."
  },
  {
    "question": "What evidence should I choose when I find a Zillow/Redfin/Realtor/Trulia listing with only a photo of the housefront?",
    "answer": "If the Zillow/Redfin/Realtor/Trulia page looks like the image below, and the photo matches full or partial with any of the pictures in the listing, you can use this evidence.\n\nIn another case, if the Zillow/Redfin/Realtor/Trulia page is as can be seen below, where there is a photo that is a street view, in this case, the evidence could not be fully or partially Zillow, because it tokes to the street view, so the evidence must be that one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do I get the Google Street View short link?",
    "answer": "1. Go to the street view and click on the copy icon located on the right side of the screen. This will automatically copy the link of the current view.\n2. To get the link of the address you found on Google Street View, click on the three dots that appear in the upper corner of the address, and then click on the share button. This will open a new window with the link to the address. Copy the link and add it to your evidence.\n\nIf the first option doesn't work, you can do it the traditional way, as shown in aption 2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What evidence should I put when I have Data from customer?",
    "answer": "That Data From Customer field can have info coming from:\n1.  License List.\n2.  Previous Provider Data, which is when a customer had a provider different than Deckard before and sends us that info to upload to Cyborg. In this case, the info is like a first step to identifying the property, and in many cases it is reliable. However, it is good to have a second evidence so that we always keep in mind the quality of the data.\n3.  Addresses from Rental Platforms.\n\nSo the evidence you can put could be \"Information linked to the owner\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to input a second evidence when I find a listing?",
    "answer": "No. When you identify a listing that has been identified with strong evidence, is not essential to input secondary evidence. For example. If you find a listing with an aerial view and it's very clear, no second evidence is needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What to consider when performing the Auto QA process?",
    "answer": "The Auto QA is performed 10 minutes before the end of your workday and is useful to correct errors made during the workday and avoid these being reported by the QA team.\nTo do this, go on Cyborg All listings all by who: your name updated at (the date of the day in the format shown by Cyborg, it is YYYY-mm-dd). It must be checked:\n\n* If the APN is correct.\n* If an address override is needed, and also if an override has been done, check if it is correctly done.\n* That the structure is correct.\n* If the Unit Box is correct.\n\nGood Practices:\n\n* Filter in the Override_Address column using \">\" (or by clicking the top arrow to sort from highest to lowest) to review all AO performed that day and ensure they are accurate.\n* It is also recommended that you randomly select a few mapped listings during the day and check that the property is correctly identified."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is QA, suggested QA, and random QA?",
    "answer": "QA is a process conducted to achieve the best quality possible on the listings we map.\n\nTo ensure this quality, in Deckard we have two different QA types:\n\n* Suggested QA: When someone is not sure about the place because there might be something slightly different that makes them feel unsure, they must tick the following box: Second review of this listing requirede suggest_qa)\n    After checking the box, a data analyst will check the questions written down on the vetting comments box and let whoever requested it know if the place is not right.\n* Random QA: Cyborg automatically selects 2% of the total listings mapped to have a second verification from the QA team, this is to ensure that the listings which are not asked to be checked again are correctly identified for the client to see."
  },

    "question": "When is it necessary to request a QA?",
    "answer": "Requesting a QA is a petition to be made in particular cases, for example:\n\nMinor discrepancies:\n\n* Structure differences.\n* APNS (Assessor's Parcel Numbers).\n* Addresses and overrides.\n* Exterior or interior differences: The chimney differs from the one shown on the platform, the kitchen is different, the housefront doesn't match, there are differences in pools or aerial views, two APNs for the same address, two different Zillows with different addresses, everything matches you but there is a door missing on the balcony of the house, the kitchen, doors, bathrooms, and bedrooms are the same but the fireplace seems to be different from the one on the platform you are comparing it with.\n\nPoints to keep in mind:\n\n* Be very specific and clear when leaving comments.\n* Ensure that if the Suggested QA flag is marked, the comments are also provided.\n* Consult with the project lead to see if the case can be resolved (easy level) before marking it as suggested.\n* Mark duplicates as well.\n\nOn the other hand, when you do have not enough evidence to know if the place is rightfully found or not, it is better to map it as Not Match Found and write the information you have compiled, thus the next person who will try to find it in Final Pass will have it easier since they know where to start from."

  {
    "question": "When do I need to use the \"Not live\" button?",
    "answer": "You should mark a listing as \"Not live\" after following these steps:\n\n1.  If you click on the listing and it takes you to the platform's main site (the listing is offline).\n2.  If Cyborg hasn't saved any information about the listing (either pictures or description).\n3.  Check in Rentalscape. (If there are any photos or any additional information, you can use those to get the match).\n\nIf all of the previous steps aren't true, then you can do the match or mark the listing as No Match Found according to the case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the photos in a listing say 'Coming Soon' or there aren't any photos at all?",
    "answer": "Verify if the listing doesn't have more information to identify it in the description, the host profile, or a duplicate with actual pictures. If there is no more information, flag it as No Match Found and add the comments accordingly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do with test listings?",
    "answer": "Sometimes people use test listings to check if the platform is working correctly for their future use. This is why we may come across listings like the one above. Cyborg cannot determine if a listing is a test listing or not, so when you find one, you should mark it as \"No Match Found\" and leave a comment stating that it is a test listing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the listings is outside of the country?",
    "answer": "If you find a listing that it's outside of the country limits, flag it as No Match Found and outside boundaries. Leave comments explaining the case. If you were able to find the coordinates of the house, you could add them to the comments but it's not required to find them if they are not evident."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can be added a MUS (Massive-Unit Structure) in Cyborg?",
    "answer": "MUS are exclusively added by the data lead of said projects. But if you want to know how the process is performed, down below you can find the explanation.\nGo to cyborg to the project you need to add a MUS to > Click on MUS (on the top of the project's page) > Click on Add new MUS > Fill out all the information requested and finally hit \"Save\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which projects are MUSs used?",
    "answer": "The projects where MUSs are used are:\n\n* FL-Sunny Isles Beach\n* FL-City of Hallandale\n* AUS City of Brisbane\n* FL-City of Cocoa Beach"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to use Address Override if there is a listing that is an NMF in a MUS?",
    "answer": "No, If you have a MUS and cannot identify the specific unit, you don't need to use Address Override or enter a Partial APN. Mark it as \"No Match Found\" and assign the correct MUS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I search the public records and the GIS for a project?",
    "answer": "1. To search for the public records, type in the Google search bar following:\n   [Project name], [STATE ABBREVIATION] [CAD] or [Property tox search]. For example: henry county, ga property tax search\n\n2. For the GIS type in the Google search bar the following:\n   [Project name], [STATE ABBREVIATION] [GIS]. For example: henry county, ga gis\n\nPublic Records and GIS data may be available at both the City and County. If you're unable to find the PR and GIS for the city, try checking with the county instead."

  {
    "question": "When and how can I use batch edit mode?",
    "answer": "A batch edit mode is a powerful tool that you can use when you have many listings that can be mapped with the same APN, such as timeshares, resorts, and U1OM (but if each unit has its unit number on the listing, you must fill out the unit box for each one).\n\nIn these cases, it is not necessary to open each listing individually and map it separately. You can use the batch edit mode with the following directions:\n\n* First, find all the listings that belong to that APN. This can be done through keywords in title, and description, hostname, and other methods.\n* As an additional step, you can block all the listings you are about to map to ensure that you are not interfering with your coworkers' work. This ensures that no one else is already working on something you might map next.\n* Next, go to the Batch edit mode box and tick it. This function allows you to show different quantities per page so you can select all of them together (10, 25, and 60 as shown below)...\n* Then, go to the \"select all and edit selected\" box. In the pop-up window, fill in all the required data and hit the save button.\n\n    Open up the pictures inside the listings, they might have important information you will miss.\n    This tool is very powerful, so make sure all the listings you map with this are certainly duplicates.\n    If you're going to perform multiple batch edits, it's recommended to click the 'Clear All' button between each one."

    "question": "What is the meaning of each Cyborg's bucket?",
    "answer": "1.  **Host name close to the owner of the nearby parcel**: In this bucket, Cyborg recognizes the hostname given by the listing to the map radius and gives you suggestions based on that information. It compares owner names with hostnames and orders the nearby parcels by similarity to those. Listings with managers as hostnames are part of this bucket, so it is better if you search for individuals' names.\n2.  **With vetted data from customers**: Sometimes when a client hires us to identify the STRs for them, they had another company doing the address identification. Thus in this bucket, we have data the client gives us to verify if that is the right place or not. Some listings can have the full address, others only have the city name, so it can change depending on the project we are working with. Inside this bucket, you can find the listings from Booking, which most of the time have a complete address.\n3.  **May have images of interest**: In this bucket, Cyborg automatically identifies listings that have images of interest. Here you can select different types:\n    * **Street number**: Cyborg automatically identifies what it thinks is a street number. When you open up the listing, a little red square will pop up with the \"street number identified\". Sometimes it can help a lot when the project consists of houses, but when it is full of units within condos, working from this bucket is not as convenient as one might think.\n    * **Housefront**: This bucket is similar to the one above, but it might have or not the street number on the housefront. What this bucket focuses on is having one photo of the front of the house.\n    * **Map**: In this bucket, you can find the listings that have a map included in their images. In most cases, the maps will have a map pin indicating the location of the property.\n    * **Aerial**: Here, you can find listings that have images of an aerial view.\n    * **Floor plan**: Here are the listings that have a floor plan in their images.\n    * **Outdoor pool**: This bucket contains properties that have photos of a pool in the listing.\n4.  **May have matching Zillow image**: Here, you can find listings that Cyborg has detected may have a property that matches, os compared to properties in Zillow.\n5.  **Likely duplicate of already mapped**: In this bucket, Cyborg gives us different options already mapped (the ones on the left) for listings that have not been mapped with any APN, nor match found or not live (the ones on the right). When you click on the listing to be mapped, the four options below pop up: Same, In same MUS, Different, Not sure.\n    * **Same**: This is used when you confirm the listing is a duplicate. The fields are automatically filled, and you can add a second piece of evidence, change the structure or just save it as it is.\n    * **In Same MUS**: This option is only used for projects that work with MUS. It is used when the listing belongs to the same location (MUS) but refers to a different unit.\n    * **Different**: When you confirm the place is not the one you are looking for.\n    * **Not sure**: This is usually used for condos due to some units looking so much alike, and you cannot just confirm if it is the right place but cannot deny it either, so you use this bottom.\n    It is important to note that the options within this category are \"yet to review and live\", which only shows live listings. The \"reviewed but not sure\" option displays listings marked with the criteria explained above. The \"default\" option shows all listings, live or not, that Cyborg identifies as possible duplicates.\n6.  **May mention address**: In this bucket, Cyborg identifies potential addresses of a listing within the description. These addresses are highlighted in red letters, as shown below.\n7.  **Unresolved**: This section contains listings that have not been mopped with an APN.\n8.  **Picked for QA**: This section contains listings that have been selected for quality assurance (QA). These listings may have been suggested for QA or selected randomly. Those that are suggested for QA show \"True\" in the suggested QA box, while those selected randomly show \"False\".\n9.  **All listings**: This section includes all listings, including unresolved ones, those mapped with an APN, and those that are mapped-to-be. The size of the project can be determined by the number of listings in this section."

    "question": "How do I find the parcel data for any county in Cyborg?",
    "answer": "We have the parcel data for all of the counties in the US. If you find a property that is outside of the county you are working in and you don't find the project active in Cyborg, you can adjust the link with the county name and find the parcel data.\n\nTo find the parcel data:\n1.  Open any project in Cyborg.\n2.  In the link, change the state, and always put the abbreviation in uppercase letters, e.g. AL, AZ, CA, NY.\n3.  Then change the county, always put the county name in lowercase letters. If it has multiple words use an underscore between words to separate them, e.g. los_angeles, san_bernardino.\n4.  As a last step, add a forward slash and an underscore after the county name, e.g. CA/los_angeles/_\n\nThe format is: https://cyborg.deckard.com/parcel/STATE/county_name/_\nExample: https://cyborg.deckard.com/parcel/AUS/queensland/_\nExample: https://cyborg.deckard.com/parcel/CA/los_angeles/_\n\nIf you try to look for a county's parcel data and it doesn't come up, make sure to double-check if you missed any of the previous steps, perhaps you entered the county in uppercose letters or you didn't put the /_ at the end. If it still doesn't work, ask your lead."
